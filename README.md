# QR Conquest

A GPS-based team capture game using QR codes for authentication and base capture. Players join teams by scanning QR codes and compete to capture and hold bases around a physical area.

## üéÆ Game Overview

QR Conquest is a real-world team-based strategy game where teams compete to capture and control bases, consisting of physical locations with a QR code. The game combines digital technology with physical movement, creating an engaging outdoor activity perfect for team building, events, or casual competition.

### For Players - The Game Experience

**Getting Started:**
You'll receive a team QR code from your game host or team captain. Simply scan this code with your phone to join your team - no app download required, everything works through your web browser. For the best GPS performance, we recommend installing the game as a PWA (Progressive Web App) when prompted by your browser.

**Joining Your Team:**
- Scan your team's unique QR code 
- Enter your name to join the team
- See your team's color and current score

**Capturing Bases:**
- Navigate to base locations shown on the interactive map
- When you're at a base, scan its QR code
- Your location is automatically verified to prevent remote captures
- Successfully captured bases change to your team's color and start earning points

**Winning the Game:**
- Teams earn points for every moment they control a base
- The longer you hold bases, the more points you accumulate
- Watch the live scoreboard to track your team's progress
- Coordinate with teammates to capture and defend strategic locations

**Game Features:**
- **Real-time Map**: See all bases and which team currently controls each one
- **Live Scoreboard**: Track team rankings as they change throughout the game
- **Offline Support**: Game continues even with poor mobile signal - captures sync automatically when connection returns
- **Team Coordination**: Work together to develop capture and defense strategies

### For Hosts - Managing Games

- **QR Scanning**: Camera-based QR code detection
- **Maps**: Interactive Leaflet maps showing base locations and ownership
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatic polling for live scoreboard updates
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile phones and tablets

### QR Code System
- **Host Authentication**: Unique secret links for host authentication
- **Team QR**: Unique UUID linking to specific team in specific game
- **Base QR**: Unique UUID linking to physical location and game
- **URL Format**: `https://yoursite.com/?id={qr_uuid}`

## üì± Installation & Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Modern web browser with camera access
- HTTPS connection (required for camera access)

### Local Development

1. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd qr-conquest
   pip install flask flask-cors
   ```

2. **Set environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export SITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD="your_secure_password"
   ```

3. **Run application**:
   ```bash
   python flask_app.py
   ```

4. **Access application**:
   - Open `http://localhost:5000` in browser
   - For camera access, use HTTPS proxy or mobile device on same network

### Production Deployment

1. **Set up HTTPS** (required for camera access):
   ```bash
   # Example with Nginx reverse proxy
   server {
       listen 443 ssl;
       server_name your-domain.com;
       
       ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
       ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem;
       
       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Configure environment**:
   ```bash
   export SITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD="strong_production_password"
   export FLASK_ENV="production"
   ```

3. **Run with production server**:
   ```bash
   # Using Gunicorn
   pip install gunicorn
   gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 flask_app:app
   ```

## üîß Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description | Example |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Yes | Password for site admin access | `secure_admin_pass_123` |
| `FLASK_ENV` | No | Flask environment mode | `production` |
| `FLASK_DEBUG` | No | Enable debug mode | `False` |

### Game Settings

- **Team Limit**: No hard limit, but 2-8 teams recommended
- **Base Limit**: No hard limit, but 5-20 bases work well
- **Capture Range**: Players must be close enough to bases for GPS verification
- **Scoring Rate**: Teams earn points continuously while controlling bases
- **Game Duration**: No time limit, manually ended by host

### Offline Support

- Base captures are queued when offline
- Automatic sync when connection restored
- Cached game data for continued play
- Visual indicators for online/offline status

## üîí Security Features

### Authentication Model
- **Three-tier security**: Site Admin ‚Üí Host ‚Üí Player
- **Secret link expiry**: Host permissions can be time-limited
- **Session management**: Persistent authentication via localStorage
- **No password storage**: Only site admin password in environment

### Data Protection
- **Input validation**: All API inputs validated
- **SQL injection protection**: Parameterized queries
- **HTTPS required**: Camera access requires secure connection
- **CORS enabled**: Cross-origin requests properly configured

### Privacy Considerations
- **Location data**: Only stored for base creation and capture verification
- **Player data**: Minimal personal information collected
- **QR codes**: Unique UUIDs with no personal information
- **Game isolation**: Each game's data is completely separate

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Camera not working**:
- Ensure HTTPS connection (required for camera access)
- Check browser permissions for camera
- Try different browser or device

**QR codes not scanning**:
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Hold camera steady and close to QR code
- Try manual entry of QR code value
- Check QR code is properly generated

**GPS not accurate**:
- Install as Progressive Web App for best performance
- Enable high accuracy mode in browser
- Wait for GPS to settle before capturing bases
- Check device has good GPS signal
- Consider testing capture range in different conditions

**Game not starting**:
- Ensure minimum 2 teams created
- Check host authentication is valid
- Verify all teams have valid QR codes
- Check game status in host panel

**Players can't join teams**:
- Check team QR codes are properly assigned
- Ensure game hasn't started yet
